The web based “Tiffin Delivery and Management System” project is an attempt to simulate the basic concepts of Tiffin Delivery and Management chain. The system is designed mainly through the perspective of the tiffin provider.
Customer needs to Sign up and check the menu and order the tiffin as per the requirement for required period. Customer needs to add his/her address where the tiffin needs to be delivered before ordering the tiffin. As per customers requirement he/she must have to do payment for the amount generated for that period according to the chosen tiffin.
The system allows the admin to post the tiffin details, manage orders and delivery staff. The admin can add new tiffin in the system, edit the existing system & delete the tiffin as per the requirement of mess provide. Admin can add new addresses where mess are available to deliver the tiffin. Admin can manage the customers. He can get currently active customers who are ordering tiffin’s from this system & can able to delete the inactive customers. Admin can add new Delivery Boy to the system & able to delete the existing Delivery Boy.
When user orders the tiffin, then that tiffin is moved to the “Pending Orders” category. When the tiffin is ready in the local mess, the admin must assign delivery boy to that particular order. After assigning the delivery boy, the status of that order is changed from “Pending” to “Dispatched.” The Delivery Boy has a basic role to accept the order and deliver the tiffin to mentioned address/location. After delivering tiffin to the specified address, the order is moved from “Dispatched” to “Delivered.”
